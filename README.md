# bikesharing
Use Tableau to create visualizations for New York City bikeshare data in 2019. The presentation will be used as part of a proposal to bring bikesharing to Des Moine, Iowa. Though NYC and Des Moine are demographically and geographically miles apart, this report may help answer the following.

- What type of user participates in bikeshare programs?
- What area of a city sees the most bikeshare usage?
- What time of day are bikes used the most and the least?
- How often and for how much time are bikes being used?

## Results

More than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers, who muse Bikeshare regularly. Bikeshare program users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8 to only about 1/4 female.

This chart represents check-out times for bikes in the Month of August. Each bar represents an average of bike renatls per hours. Between 2AM and 5AM, bike rentals are lowest, meaning it's the best time to provide maintanence on the fleet.

The busiest starting locations are in the tourism and financial district of Lower Manhattan.

This graph displays that the vast majority of trips taken on CitiBike bikes are under an half-hour in length, with a steep drop-off for bike rentals lasting over an hour.

With this graph, we get an even better visualization of the surpassing majority of users being male.

This heatmap dispalys bike usage is heaviest during weekday commute times, and weekend usage is spread throughout the middle of the day. Once again, we see lowest usage in early-morning hours.

These last two graphs furthermore reinforce bikeshare services are used primarily by men.

## Summary
In conclusion, bikeshare services are consistently used in busier metropolitan areas, mostly by men. Also, usage is densest around morning and evening commute times. 

I suggest further exploration of data with the following:

A map tracking bike routes during morning and evening rush hour time-windows, to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods.
Average trip duration by gender, by hour, and by season to determine if their is a difference between tourist and commuter demographics.
